            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p><i>Lozar Electric</i> is a business name for a group of  Electrical service renderers
                based in <i>Florida</i> and work globally.
            </p>
            <p><i>Lozar Electric</i> is primarily aimed at providing affordable and efficient electrical services.
                Not necessarily profitable but reliable and pleasant job is what exactly define us.
            </p>
            <p>In 1992, a local apprentice at a local elctric workshop thought about sometthing great
                while searching for some wires to explore how electricity works, he was doing this and 
                he made a mistake by bridging Life and Neutral cables and <i>BOOM!</i> , all the light in the
                area went off, the local grid has been affected by the mistake of this young boy.
            </p>
            <p>The boy was not alone in the workshop, his friend was also there with him,
                They both screamed and ran out of the workshop knowing that they had created
                a big mess. The apprentice since then vowed to always use quality materials
                 and work ethically whenever he gets a job knowing that the materials used
                 for the electrification in his area are not up to standard and also, the work
                 were not done ethically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Few years later, he had grown up to be a qualified electrical personnel, he sought
                for like-minded electrical proffessionals and they teamed up and created the business <i>LOZAR ELETRIC</i>.
            </p>
            <p><i>L</i> stands for <i>Louis</i>, <i>O</i> stands for <i>Otto</i>, <i>Z</i>
            stands for <i>Zeus</i>, <i>A</i>  stands for <i>Adam</i>, <i>R</i> stands for 
            <i>Reynald</i> and <i>ELECTRIC</i> was added at the back to indicate their area of
            expertise.
